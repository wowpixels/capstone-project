I started learning React during me journey acquiring the [Meta Front-End Developer Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer). In this repo you find the Capstone Project, The Little Lemon Restaurant App. The App consists mainly of the **landing and the reservation page**. I used TailwindCSS for the over-all look and feel. After successfully completing the course I achieved my Meta Front-End Developer Certificate.
